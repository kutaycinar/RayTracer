# RayTracer

This is my implementation of a ray tracer created in Python for the final assignment of CSC 305: Computer Graphics at UVic. This program renders a scene from a camera (positioned at origin) given a test file in .txt format which has parameters for the scene, the objects, and the lights. It currently supports ellipsoidal shapes (spheres scaled in x, y or z) by using the sphere quadtratic formula to find intersections. It outputs a rendered image file in color with ambient, diffuse, specular, reflection, and shadows. Multiple objects and multiple lights with varying parameters such as light color intensity are supported.
